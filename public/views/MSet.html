<h2 class="text-center">CACE Music sessions: Mikey Czepiel</h2>

<h3 class="text-center">For this installment of CACE music sessions, Mikey Czepiel, one half of Drum and Bass duo M-Set, was asked to construct a tune and bring it together in the space of ten minutes.</h3>
<br/>
<p>It’s always a special occurrence when creative spontaneity comes together perfectly. As Mikey Czepial sets up his gear and the crew ready themselves for the ten-minute production piece, there is an air of readiness and eager anticipation to see the man at work. After all preparations have been made, technicals have been tweaked and cups of tea have been swigged, the tune construction can begin. </p>

		<p>It’s clear from the moment he starts that Mikey’s vast energy and presence is translated into his music. As the elements wind up together in the impressively built House tune, everyone is enthralled. It’s a good feeling when logistics and organisation come down to a few minutes of very sharp, honest and impressive creativity. The great thing about a live performance is that all of the human imperfections of a person acting out the process can be seen and appreciated all the more; the subtle adding of filter or the introduction of an off-beat high-hat are realised as a physical process and expression as well as an audible and quantized progression. I was lucky enough to catch up with Mikey after the performance and was excited to hear his thoughts and feelings on the whole thing.</p>

<p class="italic_content">“I was excited about the opportunity because I like having the chance to do something a little bit different to what I usually do. I like the challenge and having to construct a tune differently.” Mikey tells me this after we sit down and start discussing the process of bringing together a tune in ten minutes.  In terms of the way Mikey likes to present music, he speaks of how the feelings of production and performance differ, that each form has its characteristics and with them, their own unique benefits. “When you’re doing it live, you have the flexibility and that’s great, but when I write tunes and play them as a DJ, that’s also very satisfying. I love to play my tunes out on a system, it’s a surprisingly physical experience and I feel very much part of it. I would say that I like both, with the advantage of producing and playing live being the flexibility, but with mixing there’s the precision and that physical involvement.”</p>

<p>It’s obvious that for Mikey there is an importance in surroundings concerning the way he makes music. We begin to delve into the atmosphere and sounds of the city having a conscious and sub-conscious influence on his music making.</p> <p class="italic_content">“It’s interesting when you say influences because when you look at it on a technical level, everything you ever hear will influence the way that you respond to sound. So for example when I hear a noise, whether it’s building works or roads, anything that you hear on a very macro level, it can have an emotional response.”</p>

<p>When we move on to the matter of his musical direction, I ask Mikey about his choice of genre for the ten-minute production. Given that M-set are renowned for their deep Drum and Bass sound, it was interesting to hear why he chose to develop a House tune for this challenge.</p> <p class="italic_content">“Well we’ve both been dabbling in a bit of house recently, there’s been a big resurgence of it lately. With the older generation it’s always been there, but there’s a lot of good music coming out at the moment that’s interesting much younger people. It took a while for us to take serious notice of it and when we started producing together there wasn’t much that really took our fancy, but recently there has been a lot of change in the sounds being used and a lot more of that techy, dark sound that we like. I love going to a dance and just being amazed by the intensity of the bass. That’s sort of why we’ve become interested in house. I just thought for this session it would be good to do a little house tune live.”</p>

<p>It’s indeed fair to say that there has been a resurgence in the awareness of a deeper sound that seems to be moving through dance music, bringing a lot of Techno, Dubstep and Drum and Bass influenced House to the forefront of electronic music culture. This is well evident in the tune made by Mikey for this session; it admirably incorporates his knowledge of the deeper edge into a track filled with constant movement. The build-up and structure of the tune is not dissimilar to that of Drum and Bass, but the sounds are organised in a far less sharp and more flowing arrangement. </p>

<p>I asked Mikey about his direction from here and whether his choice to make a House tune was reflective of a new path he wanted to head down.</p> <p class="italic_content">“I write a lot of music and there are a lot of people around who I make music with. People will come round and we’ll work on a tune just spontaneously, so there are a lot of tunes that are sitting around - House tunes, Drum and Bass tunes and Dubstep tunes that are just hanging around. In the future, it would be good to consolidate that under a new alias and do something with it.”</p> <p>Mikey however does insist that his work as M-Set is his main focus and credits his creative partner Alfie (the other half of M-Set) for a large part of his production ability.</p> <p class="italic_content">“If you want to learn to make music, the best way is to sit next to someone who knows what they’re doing and do it with them. Since I did that, Alfie and I have been making tunes together.” M-set have had a great year, with a number of releases as well as some interesting work with talented vocalist Hannah Eve. Great prospects are in the pipeline for them and their new track ‘All Consuming Fear’ is to be released shortly on Flexout Audio. The DnB duo are definitely one to look out for in the coming months.</p> 

<p>This session has been a great example of creativity coming into focus. The challenge of bringing together a tune in 10 minutes from various elements is no easy task and it’s always fantastic to see creative process in practice. This intimate performance was an inspiring look at how influences can be brought into context and how the very human aspect of making music can be directly translated into an electronic sound, with the right methods.</p>
